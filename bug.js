In Next.js 15, an uncommon bug can occur when using the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions in conjunction with dynamic routes and large datasets.  If the data fetching process within these functions takes an excessively long time, exceeding the timeout limits set by the server, it can lead to unexpected errors or incomplete page rendering. The default timeout might be too short, especially when dealing with external API calls or extensive database queries.
