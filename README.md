This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 related to data fetching timeouts within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` when handling dynamic routes and substantial datasets. The `bug.js` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using appropriate timeout handling and potentially optimized data fetching techniques.  The bug arises when fetching data takes longer than the default server timeout, resulting in errors or incomplete rendering. The solution addresses this by implementing more robust error handling and potentially optimizing data fetching.
